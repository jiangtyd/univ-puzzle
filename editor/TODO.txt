Overall goal:
Create puzzle editor / player / interface for solver?? for all Nikoli-style grid-based puzzles. Should be able to support things as complicated as 
http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2013/coinheist.com/get_smart/portals/answer/index.html .

UI:
* Select "type" of symbol to draw? 
- Keyboard shortcuts
* Specify what user actions do to the puzzle? (Allow: left/right-click; shift-click; ctrl-click.)


Colors:
* drag-coloring (stop coloring on leave or mouseup)
- primary/secondary color (instead of toggling)
- deleting colors?

Things in squares:
* numbers
* small symbols (dots, circles, etc.)
- masyu-style lines (allow drawing small segments between vertices, midpoints of edges, center of square)
- multiple numbers/symbols in a square (for tapa, kakuro, etc)

Things around squares:
* Draw slitherlink-style borders of varying thickness
